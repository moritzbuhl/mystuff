    Priority Information
Information about the relative priority of the entry consists
	of codes indicating the word appears in various references which
	can be taken as an indication of the frequency with which the word
	is used. This field is intended for use either by applications which
	want to concentrate on entries of  a particular priority, or to
	generate subset files.

The current values in this field are:- news1/2: appears in the "wordfreq" file compiled by Alexandre Girardi
	from the Mainichi Shimbun. (See the Monash ftp archive for a copy.)
	Words in the first 12,000 in that file are marked "news1" and words
	in the second 12,000 are marked "news2".- ichi1/2: appears in the "Ichimango goi bunruishuu", Senmon Kyouiku
	Publishing, Tokyo, 1998.  (The entries marked "ichi2" were
	demoted from ichi1 because they were observed to have low
	frequencies in the WWW and newspapers.)- spec1 and spec2: a small number of words use this marker when they
	are detected as being common, but are not included in other lists.- gai1/2: common loanwords, based on the wordfreq file.- nfxx: this is an indicator of frequency-of-use ranking in the
	wordfreq file. "xx" is the number of the set of 500 words in which
	the entry can be found, with "01" assigned to the first 500, "02"
	to the second, and so on. (The entries with news1, ichi1, spec1 and
	gai1 values are marked with a "(P)" in the EDICT and EDICT2
	files.)

The reason both the kanji and reading elements are tagged is because
	on occasions a priority is only associated with a particular
	kanji/reading pair.
