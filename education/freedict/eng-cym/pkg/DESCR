The Project:

  The Eurfa dictionary is part of a suite of lexical tools for Welsh. It
  is also available in webserver format and as CSV lists, and these
  contain mutated and verbal forms as well as the headwords in this
  version - see Eurfa (http://www.eurfa.org.uk). Verbal forms are derived
  from Konjugator (http://www.konjugator.org.uk).This Eurfa conversion is
  part of the FreeDict project (http://www.freedict.org), which aims to
  make available many translating dictionaries for free.Eurfa is used in
  Klebran, the only free Welsh spelling and grammar checker
  (http://www.klebran.org.uk). Klebran is a frontend to An Gramadóir
  (http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir), Kevin P Scannell's grammar-checking
  engine.
