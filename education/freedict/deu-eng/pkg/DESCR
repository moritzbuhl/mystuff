Changelog:

 * 2020-09-11 #eleichtfuss ver. 1.8.1-fd0.1:
   * Initial import from Ding (version 1.8.1).
   * Fixed many syntax errors and inconsistencies in the Ding
     dictionary.
   * Most explicit Ding annotations are transferred to TEI.
   * Several entries per Ding line are given references to one
     another (@type="see").
   * Entries with more than one keyword on the source language side
     are split up into multiple entries. These are linked using references
     of @type="syn".
 * 2020-10-14 #eleichtfuss ver. 1.8.1-fd0.2:
   * Identify examples to some entries; add the former to the latter
     at 'entry/sense/cit[@type="example"]' and remove the examples from
     the list of regular entries.
   * Add annotations that are only implicitly present in the Ding
     dictionary, such as: {f}, but no {pl} -> {noun}.
   * Transfer some annotations within Ding entries (e.g., when
     "Apfel" is a masculine noun, we may infer that its translation,
     "apple", is also a noun.
   * Fixed some TEI syntax, as per comments from Sebastian Humenda.
   * Recognize more types of annotations (notes).
 * 2020-10-28 #eleichtfuss ver. 1.8.1-fd0.2.1:
   * Mark units with annotated inflected forms as verbs.
 * 2022-04-15 #eleichtfuss ver. 1.9-fd1:
   * Update to Ding version 1.9.
   * Unify xr elements by @type. (Previously, each xr element
     contained exactly one ref element.)
