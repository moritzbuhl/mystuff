  This file in version 0.0.2 was compiled by Beata Wójtowicz from other
  electronic documents. It was based on "Swahili-Kiswahili to English
  Translation Program" by Morris Fried available from
  http://www.dict.org/links.html, which has been supplemented by entries
  from Freedict Swahili-English Dictionary (version 0.0.1) created by
  Horst Eyermann (http://www.freedict.de) from the Swahili-Esperanto and
  Esperanto-English Ergane dictionaries, available from
  http://www.travlang.com/. The December 2008 version (0.3), edited by
  Beata Wójtowicz and Piotr Bański, has been fixed syntactically, verified
  lexicographically and converted to the basic TEI P5 XML schema for
  dictionaries. The number of entries and the definitional parts have been
  extended. See the revisionDesc for subsequent changes.

   * Little fixes in equivalents and one bug fix in the script
     generating definitions of plurals (mifugo was broken).
 * 2009-04-17 Piotr Bański, bansp at o2.pl ver. 0.4.2:
   * Technical changes vis-a-vis Freedict TEI-to-DICT scripts:
     looking for the balance between project-specific and Freedict-wide
     properties
Split kwenye in two (preposition + copula) - this is a technical move, to unify the nesting level of <note> elements with @type="cl-agr", but it's also in agreement with our POS strategy for this stage of the present dictionary: one entry per POS, and kwenye appears to have lexicalised from whatever -enye is into an uninflected preposition.Moved class agreement information from the abused <note> elements into <gramGrp>, nested inside the regular <gramGrp>; this is another feature carried over from our Swahili-Polish-Swahili project. Unfortunately, <gramGrp> may not carry the @type argument. I could use a <gram> element for this without nesting gramGrps, but the nested gramGrp is intended as a feature structure that holds all agreement information in a single package.All generated plural entries are now @type="pl" (by script). There are 522 such entries in this version.xr/@type="plural-sense" is gone and replaced with the (abused) note/@type="def". This is to make sure that the content of generated plurals will be treated as single definitions later on.note/@type="num" is augmented by @rend="noindent"; this is project-specific and pertains to the way the DICT databases are created. This is not meant to be filled by hand, a script does that when converting the editable dictionary into the final form.The "tokens in definitions" count rose sharply because of the extra words "Plural of" repeated 522 times (they used to be part of <xr>) and also colons or sense numbers in some of the definitions of plurals. This may suggest a change of the formula for this count (or dropping it altogether). OTOH, ignoring plural entries from this count does not seem fair, given that they are by all means informative. The code is now "sum(for $txt in (/TEI/text/body/entry/sense//def/descendant::text() | /TEI/text/body/entry/sense/note[@type ne 'editor']/descendant::text()) return count(tokenize(normalize-space($txt),' ')))" - I have fixed it to catch all text nodes, which the previous counts didn't.   * The intended simplicity of encoding and incremental building of
     Freedict dictionaries relies to some extent on bordering on tag
     abuse. Instead of distinguishing between <usg> and <note> elements,
     I'd rather use more kinds of notes. Added:
type="lbl" for notes within (definitional) notes - currently only labelling literal translations,@type="usage" for notes describing the usage of the given headword/sense.@type="dom" for crude characteristics of the domain of usage; includes hypernyms (date-fruit).@type="obj" for typical object (most of these values come straight from the Guidelines).   * Rule: all <note> elements that precede the given equivalent
     should be inside its <def> (for ease of transformation into c5 and
     CSS rendering only).
   * Things that should eventually get beautified/modified (while
     keeping an eye on the balance between project-"neutral" tools and
     project-specific demands:
benki <n> (pl: {mabenki}) [sg=pl] - mark the lexical (class) ambiguity of the noun (or wait until class info is provided explicitly)in some contexts, some elements are rendered in c5 with a preceding blank line. This is due to legacy code that doesn't really harm, so I do not intend to fix that for now * 2009-03-15 #bansp #wierzchob ver. 0.4.1:
   * This is largely a maintenance release with minor fixes and
     additions.
   * New subcategories of locatives: unspec for "unspecified" (-ko),
     spec for "specified" (-po), in for "within" (-mo)
   * From editionStmt for version 0.4.1:
Beata Wójtowicz: minor fixes and POS corrections, entries for -enye and the locative copulas;Piotr Bański: minor header changes wrt the updated FreeDict scripts, lexicographic consultation, minor fixes in equivalents. * 2009-02-15 #bansp #wierzchob ver. 0.4:
   * Fixed mistakes found in version 0.3.
   * Nouns of class 9 (the 'N class') are marked as 'type="N"' on
     their <form> element. This is used to signal that their plural forms
     (class 10) are identical to the respective singulars.
   * Plural forms added in all applicable cases and identified the
     sg=pl pairs (= class N). Plurals are essentially back-references to
     singulars (citing their content), although in some cases, a specific
     "plural" (collective, mass) meaning is also provided. Note that e.g.
     the information on benki as seen in the browser view ("benki [sg=pl]
     (pl: mabenki)") signals that benki is ambiguous between class 9 (no
     plural marking) and class 5 (plural in ma-).
   * Some classes of vocabulary added/expanded (e.g. names of
     countries and their inhabitants; the present-tense irregular paradigm
     of wa na added)
   * No more parentheses inside <def> elements, more types of notes:
hint - the most general and genericgram - grammatical information (valency, POS of the equivalent, etc.)def - the real definition, it will become the <def> element in the next versioncl-agr - (abused) holds information on classes that the given element agrees with, used only for comma-separated lists of valueseditor - internal, hidden from usersnum - (abused, could be 'gram') holds information on the number of "you/your/yours" in English equivalents   * Many more references - types of <xr> elements:
cf - 'see also', genericsyn - points at synonymsimp-form - points at an (irregular) imperative form, could be made more generic ('inflection')infl-base - points at the stem from an inflected formplural-form - points at the plural from between <form> and <gramGrp>plural-sense - points at the singular from inside <sense>   * Many POS and subcategorization changes; for example, 'expr' now
     indicates "portmanteau" (cumulative) grammatical words, some
     conjunctions and interjections have been identified
   * Changed/introduced some header elements for compatibility with
     the Freedict build system (indicated in comments)
   * The accompanying CSS stylesheet has been modified to provide a
     work view of the dictionary
   * 2612 entries, 2629 headwords, 5027 tokens in definitions,
     computed by sum(for $txt in //def | //sense/note[@type ne 'editor']
     return count(tokenize(normalize-space($txt),' ')))
   * Some of the development of this dictionary and the Freedict
     project has been described in a paper entitled "A repository of free
     lexical resources for African languages: the project and the method"
     by Piotr Bański and Beata Wójtowicz, accepted for the AfLaT-2009
     (Language Technologies for African Languages) workshop, part of the
     12th meeting of the European Association for Computational
     Linguistics (EACL).
   * TO DO:
whatever is mentioned in the previous todo list and not done hereintroduce more robust grammatical description in <gramGrp>, taking over the content of some <note> elements; split complex <subc> elementsadd many more verbs and adjectives; add more cycles of function wordsadd explicit class information to nouns (this is what the cl-agr notes refer to)Add Freedict-specific notes on the last editor of the entry and the level of certainty.describe the markupadd usage examples (in the cit/quote system)consider using <gramGrp> (or even <form>, for capitalization, see e.g. msahafu) within particular <sense>s, where appropriate.   * From editionStmt for version 0.4:
Beata Wójtowicz: verification and correction of entries, addition of new entries (among others, complete sg-pl pairing)Piotr Bański: more explicit XML structure, lexicographic consultation, fixes/additions, mostly in the English part * 2008-12-30 #bansp #wierzchob ver. 0.3:
   * Redesign of the scheme for this dictionary (with focus on the
     microstructure).
   * Setting the foundation for the subcategorisation of parts of
     speech -- currently used for pronouns (cf. ake or hawa) and causative
     verbs only.
   * Partial introduction of singular-plural pairings (coded as a
     reference system, cf. fanikio vs. mafanikio).
   * Irregular plurals are indicated, cf. jambo.
   * Some other irregular inflections are also marked cf. njoo or
     hakuna.
   * Added cross-entry references. Currently restricted to synonyms
     and the generalized "see also".
   * Organized (sub)senses better.
   * Added usage notes. Currently restricted to note/@type="hint"
     (and abused in imperative forms of verbs), pending the switch from
     the <def> system to the cit/quote system of the later stage of TEI
     P5. (Note that the CSS also supports <note> elements without the
     @type attribute - these are reserved for internal use and are removed
     from the final version or turned into XML comments).
   * Equivalents are still listed in <def> elements (some of them
     separated by commas and with extra information in brackets, cf.
     chako). This is inherited from the earlier versions and will be
     changed in the next one.
   * Eliminated entries for 'prepositional' phrases in -a -- their
     meanings can be regularly constructed from the relevant nouns.
     Eliminated double entries. Fixed malformed entries.
   * The number of headwords increased from 1542 (including double
     entries and 'prepositional' phrases in -a) in version 0.0.2 to 2060
     (count(//orth)) in version 0.3.
   * The number of tokens in the definitional parts of entries,
     computed by sum(for $txt in //def | //note[@type='hint'] return
     count(tokenize(normalize-space($txt),' '))), increased from 2143 in
     version 0.0.2 to 4139 in version 0.3.
   * Created and added a CSS stylesheet (linked by a processing
     instruction) to make maintenance and review easier.
   * Expanded the header to provide more information and the change
     log.
   * Added a DTD and a Relax NG schema, both derived from a TEI P5
     ODD for with the Dictionaries module (attached).
   * Bumped the version number up by one decimal point (this is no
     longer an alpha release), to 0.3.
   * Some of the goals of the next version must be
better machine-readability (the cit/quote system with no commas or parentheses in the equivalents)complete singular-plural pairingirregular inflections should be handled better, and cross-referenced to a greater extentmore spelling variants should be capturedpossibly, more thorough subcategorizationthe distinction between free (e.g. wangu) and bound (e.g. -angu) elements should be markeda thorough overview and disambiguation of senses by means of usage notes or further equivalentspossibly, more cross-entry references should be provided   * From editionStmt for version 0.3:
Beata Wójtowicz: verification and correction of entries, addition of new entriesPiotr Bański: conversion to TEI P5, more explicit XML structure, more detailed teiHeader, lexicographic consultation * 2004-06-24 Beata Wójtowicz, wierzchob at wp.pl ver. 0.0.2:
   * Created version 0.0.2. on the basis of "Swahili-Kiswahili to
     English Translation Program" by Morris D. Fried.
   * It was supplemented with entries selected from version 0.0.1 by
     Horst Eyermann (who concatenated the Ergane Swahili-Esperanto and
     Esperanto-English dictionaries in 2000).
   * POS information was added to the entries that came from 0.0.1
     Repetitions in the sense part were eliminated.
   * The dictionary was marked up in TEI P4.
