Notes:

 * Database Status: big enough to be useful

 * This dictionary has been parsed from a plain text file. Although the
   parser attempts to be clever, it might well be that certain text
   fragments are categorized as grammatical information, or vice versa.
   Please report these issues to the maintainer or to the FreeDict
   project.The original dictionary has been changed at a few places. These
   changes are mostly to make the dictionary better parseable.

Changelog:

 * 2017-09-10 Sebastian Humenda <shumenda at gmx dot de> ver. 1.0.1:
   The importer script omitted characters at the beginning of words, if
   a headword started with "to". The newly imported versions has fixed
   this bug.
 * 2017-07-09 Sebastian Humenda <shumenda at gmx dot de> ver. 1.0:
   Initial conversion of the dictionary. At the moment, the dictionary
   needs a bit of patching to be transformed correctly. When there's
   enough interest, that might hchange.
