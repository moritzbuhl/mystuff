Notes:

 * Database Status: small

 * Anmerkungen zum Wörterbuch (English version below): Verben mit
   regelmäßiger A-Konjugation sind nur in der Infinitivform und in der
   ersten Person aufgeführt. Das Indexwort eines Verbes ist die erste
   Person Singular, die anderen Formen werden aber auch aufgeführt; für
   einige Verben musste hierfür eine Ausnahme gemacht werden.
   Übersetzungen werden häufig nur in ihrer maskulinen Form aufgeführt,
   auch wenn die anderen Formen existieren. Phrasen die aus zwei
   Satzteilen bestehen, sind mit einem "..." verbunden.

 * Please note: Verbs with the regular 'a' conjugation are only listed in
   their infinitive and first person form. The headword of a verb is the
   first-person form, but you find the other forms as well; some
   exceptions have been made for verbs which only exist in the third
   person. Translations are often only listed in their masculine form,
   even though they exist in the feminine and neuter form as well. phrases
   consisting of two parts are connected with " .. ".
