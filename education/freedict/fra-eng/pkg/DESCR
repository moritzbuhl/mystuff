Changelog:

 * 2018-08-11 Sebastian Humenda ver. 0.4.1:
   Remove duplicates
 * 2017-12-03 Sebastian Humenda ver. 0.4:
   * update licencing stanza (thanks to Karl Bartel)
   * remove duplicated entries
 * 2014-08-10 Yota Moteuchi ver. 0.3.5:
   <sense> tags were not properly set (after the previous conversion of
   <def>). Corrections were half automatic, half manual, but the content
   should not have changed. The file was also fully re-indented with
   xmllint.
 * 2010-11-05 Piotr Bański ver. 0.3.4:
   Technical changes: added the missing values to the <tagsDecl>. TODO:
   conversion to the cit/quote system, but only after, or at the same time
   as, the equivalents inside <def> are split apart.
 * 2010-04-27 Piotr Bański ver. 0.3.3:
   Technical changes: took out the dependency including the ontology
   interface. The interface is now a free-standing document and this
   dictionary refers to rhat document only via the header (see
   <tagsDecl>).
 * 2010-04-24 Piotr Bański ver. 0.3.3:
   Technical changes: include the FreeDict interface to ontologies, use
   @ana to refer to it from inside gramGrp.
 * 2010-04-22 John Darrington ver. 0.3.2:
   Extended the dictionary (several commits: added POS fields, genders,
   + over 300 entries). (+ Piotr: little changes in the header, tiny
   fixes).
 * 2010-03-05 Piotr Bański ver. 0.3.1:
   Merged the old header in. Converted the dictionary to TEI P5,
   replaced ndashes (or something of that sort, also within headwords)
   with plain hyphens. Reorganised the directory (NEWS and README out,
   stuff from shared/ in).
 * 2010-03-04  ver. 0.3:
   John Darrington
   * Lots of new words added, (a few deleted) parts of speech added.
     Genders added. Some horrible errors corrected. Probably some new
     errors introduced.
   * Verbs were identified using "verbiste", nouns by using
     freedict's fra-deu dictionary (definitions starting with upper case
     were assumed to be nouns).
 * 2006-12-21 Michael Bunk:
   Re-Import from Ergane: fra.mdb from 2005-Sep-14, eng.mdb from
   2006-Feb-02. Part of speech and gender information now included.
   teidiff gave the following output: Unmodified 487, Added 5821, Deleted
   4173, Modified <form> 1587, Modified <sense>s 877, Modified multimatch
   707 + 788.
 * 2005-01-04 Michael Bunk:
   Switched to Makefile.common style. Converted file from TEI P3 to TEI
   P4.
 * 2000-04-27 Horst Eyermann:
   Database was converted to TEI format and checked into CVS.
 * 2000-01-09 Horst Eyermann:
   Phonetics added - machine generated from MBRODICT.
 * 2000-01-01 Horst Eyermann:
   This Database was generated from ergane, http://www.travlang.com -
