   All the regular plurals have been marked up, some irregular plurals may
   still be in lbl tag. Next steps will be to merge entries with the same
   headword (number of character is one of the freelang file limits) and
   to remove redundant infos (ie there are two entries for a-dreuz:
   a-dreuz and dreuz (a-)).

   Some words added, corrections. Still not yet comply with real TEI
   P5.

   Some words added (mostly computer sciences words). Mark up
   improvments. Additions could be entry, sense or cit. All of those
   additions have been marked with attribute who and sometimes src. Some
   entries, sense or cit have been marked with rev attribute, meaning to
   be reviewed.
