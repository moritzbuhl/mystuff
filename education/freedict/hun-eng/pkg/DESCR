Changelog:

 * 2017-12-06 Sebastian Humenda ver. 0.4.1:
   update licencing stanza (thanks to Karl Bartel)
 * 2017-10-29 Sebastian Humenda ver. 0.4:
   convert dictionary to TEI P5. Upstream is inactive and hence it
   makes more sense to fork upstream and open the dictionary for
   corrections.
 * 2014-09-14 Michael Bunk:
   Attempt to fix Debian #759952: FTBFS: hun-eng.tei:69: parser error :
   Premature end of data in tag body line 67 Debian sbuild runs a parallel
   make, which seems to cause the "fails to build". hun-eng.tei.header is
   71 lines long, similar to the parser error in line 69. Previously, the
   Makefile target for hun-eng.tei created the destination file in several
   steps, using the target name from the beginning. Now two temporary
   files are created and hun-eng.tei is used only for the final step.
   Hopefully this will sbuild/parallel make use hun-eng.tei for building
   hun-eng.c5 only after hun-eng.tei is ready. See also

 * 2014-02-16 Michael Bunk:
   Converted converter from P4 to P5
 * 2005-03-07 Michael Bunk:
   Reimport from source. There are now almost 3000 entries more, don't
   know why. Fixes Bug #920855 (Index and dict file for Hungarian-English
   dictionary is bad), which included an encoding problem and missing
   spaces, besides an incorrectly sorted .index file for dictd.
 * 2004-12-29 Michael Bunk:
   Converted TEI file from P3 to P4
 * 2000-11-06 Horst Eyermann:
   Import from source
