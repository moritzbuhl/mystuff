Changelog:

 * 2010-10-25 Piotr Bański:
   Conversion of TEI P4 source into P5 via tools/freedict_P4toP5.xsl.
   The dictionary was very clearly reversed and is a nice example of the
   difference between definitions and equivalents - it now has the former
   definitions as the headwords.
 * 2005-06-12 Michael Bunk:
   TEI Header updated
