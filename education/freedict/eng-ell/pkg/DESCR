Changelog:

 * 2017-11-29 Sebastian Humenda ver. 0.1.1:
   * remove loads of empty pos tags (improves formatting)
   * unify licencing stanza (thanks to Karl Bartel
 * 2009-11-09 Piotr Bański ver. 0.1:
   * Created version 0.1 on the basis of the English-Greek dictionary
     distributed by the XDXF project
   * This involved a clean-up of the original and conversion to TEI
     P5 simplified markup, according to the ideas sketched in a paper
     entitled "A repository of free lexical resources for African
     languages: the project and the method" by Piotr Bański and Beata
     Wójtowicz, accepted for the AfLaT-2009 (Language Technologies for
     African Languages) workshop, part of the 12th meeting of the European
     Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL). The paper is
     available from the ACL web archive
     [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0713].
   * What follows is a copy of my notes written down during the
     clean-up stage and placed in the transitory file included in the
     first distribution of this dictionary (this is not entered in the
     CVS; sorry about the CDATA and rendering): This glossary has been
     apparently put together from two others, using different headword
     conventions, different diacritics and at least in part being prepared
     by non-expert lexicographers. In part, it's a phrase book. It also
     appears to contain some specialized zoological terminology. It comes
     from the XDXF project housed at Sourceforge. Changes in the XDXF
     file: * some homophones are not disambiguated by means of POS, and
     some are collapsed into a single entry - I didn't fix such cases. *
     braces inside <k> became dtrn/"dom"; inside <ar>: dtrn/"hint" * threw
     away over 200 duplicated entries, merged some of them, split a few
     others, especially around slashes; removed stray diacritics, fixed
     capitalization (to some extent only) * introduced <dtrn> instead of
     brackets or braces (needed a <note>-like element) * tried to avoid
     touching equivalents, added Αθήνα to Athens (hmm), threw away stuff
     like <ar><k>burst out into tears</k> ξεσπώ σε δάκρυα, ξεσπώ σε
     γέλια</ar> (there weren't many such cases, mostly of them involved
     duplicated headwords or equivalents; I only fixed those equivalents
     that I noticed in the process of pruning [some!] duplicate headwords)
     * the ordering of entries here is changed from the original (I wanted
     to have identical headwords next to each other, then I resorted);
     threw away lots of whitespace * changed "sea sick" into "I am
     sea-sick", according to the translation - it could be "be sea-sick"
     as well; in general, there are lots of entries in "I", "be", "a" or
     "the", etc...; sometimes the only difference is in the handling of
     compounds ("seasick" vs. "sea-sick" vs. "sea sick") * this dictionary
     (well, glossary) needs LOTS of lexicographic work still <dtrn> is
     just an abused element here; according to the XDXF spec, dtrn had the
     @type attribute, but the DTD wouldn't allow it, so I added: <!ATTLIST
     dtrn type CDATA #IMPLIED> Values: "hint" for further
     explanations/examples in Greek, "infl" for inflections of the
     headword (used inconsistently in the source), "pos" (inconsistent)
     for POS values of headwords in cases that I noticed during the
     clean-up phase "dom" for some domain restrictions, etc., provided in
     English "colloc" for broadly understood collocates of the headword or
     sense restrictions "variant" inconsistent: for spelling variants
     (instal(l)ment) but also dialectal variants (autumn/fall) and
     abbreviations "editor" for internal notes Before the transformation
     into TEI, it has 20973 entries, some of which are still duplicated,
     and some of which should be split (e.g. "Norwegian", into adj and
     noun, etc.). The XDXF original had 21237 <ar> elements. Piotr Bański,
