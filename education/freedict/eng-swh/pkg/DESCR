Changelog:

 * 2017-12-03 Sebastian Humenda ver. 0.2.2:
   Update licence stanza (thanks to Karl Bartel)
 * 2010-11-02 Piotr Bański:
   Changed database name from eng-swa to eng-swh (by ISO 639-3).
 * 2010-02-25 Piotr Bański:
   Upgraded to TEI P5, removed whitespace from equivalents, sorted
   entries, sorted entry insides, wrapped <def> in <sense> and added
   <gramGrp> with an empty <pos> in the entries that had no POS. This is
   now an example of minimal TEI P5 conformance. Changed the header very
   slightly. Added brackets around "plural" in headwords.
 * 2007-02-13 Michael Bunk:
   Enabled phonetics import.
 * 2004 Beata Wójtowicz:
   Compiled swa-eng from two sources (see the sourceDesc) and got it
   reversed to create this one.
