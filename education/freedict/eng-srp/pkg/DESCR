Changelog:

 * 2017-12-03 Sebastian Humenda ver. 0.1.3:
   update licence stanza (thanks to Karl Bartel)
 * 2010-12-09 Piotr Bański:
   Added @xml:lang attributes and profileDesc/langUsage.
 * 2010-12-01 Piotr Bański:
   Database name changed from eng-scr to eng.srp. I assume this
   dictionary to be close in nature to the previous scr-eng (current
   srp-eng) in that the latter contained Serbian with Montenegrin
   dialectal additions (thanks to Dr. Jerzy Molas of the University of
   Warsaw for his remarks on scr-eng, which I assume to hold for eng-scr,
   because they have the same origin in Ergane). TODO: identify the
   Montenegrin additions and mark them with <usg> elements.
 * 2010-11-01 Piotr Bański:
   Conversion of TEI P4 source into P5 via
   tools/xsl/freedict_P4toP5.xsl; manual clean-up.

   Converted file to TEI P4
 * 2000-04-27 Horst Eyermann:
   Database was converted to TEI format and checked into CVS
