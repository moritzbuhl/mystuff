Changelog:

   * update licencing stanza (thanks to Karl Bartel)
   * remove duplicated entries
   * fix enumeration in one translation
 * 2010-10-24 Piotr Ba≈Ñski:
   Conversion of TEI P4 source into P5 via tools/freedict_P4toP5.xsl;
   manual clean-up. We are back to version from before Michael Bunk's
   re-import from Ergane of 2006-12-20 that was rolled back due to
   Ergane's cryptic change of database licensing. Multi-word equivalents
   should be split by spaces. And it looks like their headwords only keep
   the 1st word (check out "All").
