The first deliverable of HashClash is a fast collision generating
algorithm for MD5.  This method finds collisions without any special
properties (other than those that can be expected from the Wang-type
methods).

The version 1.0.0.5 is not only extended with V. Klima's tunnels,
but also with additional differential paths to speed up collision
finding.
