ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a
language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
Java, C#, Python, or C++ actions.

ANTLR is popular because it is easy to understand, powerful, flexible,
generates human-readable output, and comes with complete source.  ANTLR
provides excellent support for tree construction, tree walking, and
translation.

The ANTLR3 recognizer generation tool is written in Java, but allows
the generation of code targeted for a number of other languages.
Each target language provides a code generation template for the
tool and a runtime library for use by generated recognizers. The C
runtime tracks the Java runtime releases and in general when a new
version of the tool is released, a new version of the C runtime
will be released at the same time.
