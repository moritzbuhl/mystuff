Poly/ML is a Standard ML implementation originally written in an
experimental language called Poly. It has been fully compatible
with the ML97 standard since version 4.0. For a full history, see
here.

Poly/ML takes a conservative approach to the Standard ML language
and avoids incompatible extensions. It has added various library
extensions particularly the thread library. Poly/ML's active
development and unique features make it an exceptional implementation.
