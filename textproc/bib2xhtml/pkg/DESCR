bib2xhtml is a program that converts BibTeX files into HTML (specifically XHTML 1.0). The conversion is mostly done by specialized BibTeX style files, derived from a converted bibliography style template. This ensures that the original BibTeX styles are faithfully reproduced. Some postprocessing is performed by Perl code. More information, documentation, and examples can be found on the bib2xhtml home page:
