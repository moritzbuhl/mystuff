Rosenpass implements a post-quantum-secure key exchange in the
spirit of a Noise protocol. The motivating use case is integrating
with the WireGuard VPN: In this mode, the key generated by Rosenpass
is supplied to WireGuard as its pre-shared symmetric key (PSK).
This results in a WireGuard VPN connection with hybrid post-quantum
security.
