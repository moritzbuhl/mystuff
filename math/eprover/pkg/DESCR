E is an equational theorem prover. That means it is a program that
you can stuff a mathematical specification (in many-sorted first-order
logic with equality) and a hypothesisconjecture into, and which
will then run forever, using up all of your machines resources.
Very occasionally it will find a proof for the conjecture and tell
you so
